# Splatoon 3 Ability Miner

Ability tool for Splatoon 3.

Based on the write-up by @Leanny (<https://leanny.github.io/splat3seedchecker/#/writeup>)

At the time this was written, this was the only known way to determine the random seeds used for gear ability rolls; this tool can calculate a gear seed in around 5 seconds, whereas the dataminerâ€™s own tool took around one minute. This tool was created with the intention of being embedded into their web application, but before that could happen a better method was found, making this tool obsolete.
